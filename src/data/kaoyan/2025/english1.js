      passage: `The grammar school boy from Stratford-upon-Avon has landed a scholarly punch after groundbreaking research showed that Shakespeare does benefit children's literacy and emotional development. But only if you act him out.

A study found that a "rehearsal room" approach to teaching Shakespeare broadened children's vocabulary and the complexity of their writing as well as their emotional literacy. "The research shows that the way actors work makes a big difference to the way children use language and also how they think about themselves," Jacqui O'Hanlon of the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), which commissioned the study said.

The randomised control trial involved hundreds of year 5 pupils - aged nine and ten - at 45 state primary schools that had not been "previously exposed to RSC pedagogy." They were split into target and control groups and asked to write, for example, a message in a bottle as Ferdinand after the shipwreck in The Tempest. The target group was given a 30-minute drama-based activity to accompany the passage.

The peer-reviewed results showed that the target group of pupils drew on a wider vocabulary, used words "classed as more sophisticated or rarer", and wrote at greater length. They also "appear to be more comfortable writing in role... while [control] pupils imagine how they themselves would react to being shipwrecked, [target] children put themselves in the shoes of a literary character and express that character's emotion".

The Time to Act study also found that while control pupils relied on "desert island clichés", target pupils were "more resilient in their writing, more hopeful". She added "The emotional understanding was very evident and it is probably related to the [rehearsal room process] where you are used to trying to imagine your way through. They were comfortable in describing different emotional states and part of what you do in drama is put yourself in different shoes".

The study showed the importance of embedding arts in education, she said. "But could the results be replicated with any old dramatist? O'Hanlon said more research would be needed but suggested that Shakespeare's use of 20000 words, compared with the everyday 2000 words, gave a "massive expansion of language into children's lives", which was combined with children 'using their whole bodies to bring words to life'.`,

      passage: `I was shocked to learn recently that some scientists want to scale back their research in an effort to decrease carbon emissions. The crisis is here, they said, and we need to cut back on our energy-intensive modelling. At the very least, we need to make our energy use far more sustainable.

It is unarguable that our laboratories, scientific instruments, rockets and satellites - the tools we scientists need to measure the planet's pulse - demand significant amounts of energy both in their construction and operation. And it is equally true that science's unrelenting appetite for information has caused a mushrooming of energy-intensive data centres around the world. According to the International Energy Agency, these buildings now consume about 1 percent of the world's electricity.

If the world is to meet its net-zero ambitions, we must think hard about how we can deliver sustainable computing and deliver more LUMIs. Every day, scientists, technologists and engineers are discovering new ways to exploit renewable energy sources and develop techniques not just to use power more intelligently but to power our intelligence.

A great example of this is Europe's largest supercomputer, LUMI in Finland, which is astonishingly carbon-negative. Established in an old paper mill, it is powered by a nearby river and its remote heating system warms thousands of homes in the local town.`,

      passage: `Ever since taking on Netflix Inc at its own game, old Hollywood has struggled to turn a profit in streaming, with the likes of Disney+, Peacock and Paramount losing billions of dollars each year, sparking concerns that the services will never be as profitable as cable once was.

But the age of streaming has been a boon for some unintended winners: pirates that use software to rip a film or television show in seconds from legitimate online video platforms and host the titles on their own, illegitimate services, which rake in about $2 billion annually from ads and subscriptions.

With no video production costs, illegal streaming sites have achieved profit margins approaching 90%, according to the Motion Picture Association (MPA), a trade group representing Hollywood studios that's working to crack down on the thousands of illegal platforms that have cropped up in recent years.

Initially the rise of legitimate online businesses such as Netflix actually helped curb digital piracy, which had largely been based on file uploads. But now piracy involving illegal streaming has surged.

"The people who are stealing our movies and our television shows and operating piracy sites are not mom and pop operations," says Charlie Rivkin, chief executive officer of the MPA. "This is organized crime."

Rivkin joined the MPA in 2017 after the organization failed five years earlier to build consensus between Hollywood and Silicon Valley to win passage of legislation in Congress aimed at stopping online piracy. In 2017 the association formed the Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment (ACE), an enforcement task force of about 100 detectives circling the globe to help local authorities arrest streaming pirates.

ACE says it's helped shrink the number of illegal streaming services in North America to 126, from more than 1,400 in 2018, aided in part by the MPA's support for a 2020 federal law that made large-scale streaming of copyright material a serious crime.`,

      passage: `Visit any antiques store and you'll encounter artifacts from the past: photographs, letters, a brochure detailing the Sinclair dinosaur exhibit from the 1964-65 World's Fair, the ephemera of history. Yet these objects aren't truly ephemeral, because they're still here, decades, even centuries later. Why? Because they're tangible.

Have you pondered the life cycle of intangible formats, digital information, given that those who produce these artifacts seldom make provision for their long-term preservation?

For millennia, we've known what we've known due to artifacts that have survived, often despite their original creators' neglect. The thing itself is the medium that delivers the information. At the time of creation, no attempts were made at intentional preservation, yet analog materials have a chance of surviving and serving as the historical record that biographers, historians, and novelists rely on.

Libraries and archives have traditionally shouldered the responsibility of organization, preservation and access. Yet now we face an embarrassment of historical riches, which brings its own needle-and-haystack problems.

Librarians' innate altruism can act against us when users point to universality of access by holding up a cell phone and saying, "it's all in here," or noting "I never have to leave my laptop" as evidence that libraries are less vital for researchers today. Yet how was that universality of access made possible and, perhaps more importantly, how is it maintained? Who curates what is preserved?

When it comes to born-digital information, the terrifying answer can be: if not librarians and archivists, then no one. Digital information requires a great deal more care than analog. Even when a digital object is preserved, it may only be the carrier that's saved, not the information itself. As technology advances and a format becomes obsolete, the object is useless.

Have you ever stared helplessly at a ZIP disk, thinking: how do I get the files off this? Without constant migration of digital assets, a nightmare about the foreseeable future is what keeps historians up at night: a historical record that abruptly stops when digital replaces analog.`,

      passage: `[A] Peters likes to photograph butterflies in a landscape, celebrating the beauty of their surroundings as well as the insects themselves. His pictures of a Glanville fritillary rising from the sea-pinks beside the chalk cliffs of Compton Bay on the Isle of Wight are particularly glorious.

[B] Peters' signature shot is a butterfly "take-off", showing the multiple wing-beats of one butterfly in one frame as it lifts off from a flower. How does he capture it? Technology helps. A typical digital SLR camera shoots 20 frames a second. He uses a high-speed OM System which shoots 120 frames a second.

[C] Britain has relatively few butterfly species compared with mainland Europe and 80% are in decline, mostly because intensive chemical farming has reduced many species to tiny fragments of habitat and small nature reserves.

[D] "I was waiting for surgery, feeling really ill, sitting in my garden. It was amazing weather and there were painted lady butterflies everywhere," he says. "They were a symbol of fragile life, of hope and defiance, and something appealed to my soul."

[E] That makes it sound easy, and artificial, but Peters insists it is still a massive challenge. He typically takes between 10,000 and 20,000 shots to get one butterfly take-off sequence in focus.

[F] So what's the appeal of a long, sweaty day in pursuit of an elusive, fast-moving wild animal? "It just feels bloody brilliant," says Peters.

[G] A children's author and poet who had become a keen amateur photographer, Peters watched the butterflies and decided to document Britain's species in a beautiful new book.

[H] A butterfly takes off so quickly it is still impossible to react quickly enough to capture that take-off but if he half-presses the shutter, the camera saves the 70 previous frames before the moment he actually takes the picture.`,

      passage: `Innovation and research have relied on public participation in science for centuries. It was a musician who discovered the planet Uranus in the 18th century by making his own telescope with mirrors composed of copper and tin.

(46) Recent decades have seen more engagement in the subject as the idea that science can only be done through institutions such as a university has been challenged. Citizen science provides an opportunity for greater public engagement and the democratisation of science.

In the information era, large data sets, small teams and financial restrictions have slowed scientific progress. (47) By harnessing the curiosity of the general public it is possible to overcome many of these challenges by engaging non-scientists directly in the research process.

Anyone can be a citizen scientist, regardless of age, nationality or academic experience. You don't even need any formal training, just an inquisitive mind and the enthusiasm to join one of the thousands of citizen science projects.

(48) Scientists have employed a variety of ways to engage the general public in their research, such as making data analysis into an online game or sample collection into a smartphone application.

This form of accessible science means that great minds are able to join the race to create and develop projects with the potential to change the world. (49) A citizen science-based approach can extend the field of vision and include different ideas and different brains to problem-solve and create, making innovation faster and more effective.

The rise of citizen science has grown alongside the rise of do-it-yourself biology. There are around 40 official do-it-yourself biology centres across the globe. (50) They pool resources, collaborate, think outside the box, and find solutions and ways around obstacles to explore science for the sake of science without the traditional boundaries of working inside a formal setting.`,

          referenceAnswer: `The table illustrates the average ownership of major durable consumer goods per 100 households in China from 2014 to 2023, including air conditioners, washing machines, and refrigerators.

As is clearly shown, all three categories have witnessed steady growth over the decade. Air conditioner ownership has nearly doubled from 75.2 units in 2014 to 145.9 units in 2023, representing the most significant increase. Washing machine ownership rose from 83.7 to 98.2 units, while refrigerator ownership increased from 85.5 to 103.4 units.

Several factors contribute to this trend. First, China's rapid economic development has substantially increased household income, enabling more families to afford these appliances. Second, urbanization has created greater demand for modern living conveniences. Third, technological advances have made these products more affordable and energy-efficient.

This upward trend reflects the remarkable improvement in Chinese people's living standards and quality of life. It also indicates the success of China's economic reforms and the growing purchasing power of its citizens.`
